NOTE: If you use custom ERGM terms based on ‘ergm.userterms’ version
prior to 3.1, you will need to perform a one-time update of the package
boilerplate files (the files that you did not write or modify) from
‘ergm.userterms’ 3.1 or later. See help('eut-upgrade') for
instructions.

NOTE: Dynamic network modeling functionality (STERGMs) has been moved
to a new package, ‘tergm’.
